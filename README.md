# Interpretable Cardiovascular Risk Stratification

This repository contains the code and report for a machine learning project focused on clinically interpretable heart disease risk prediction.

## Contents
- `Byte2Beat.ipynb`: Reproducible Jupyter notebook with data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and interpretability
- `Interpretable_Cardiovascular_Risk_Stratification.pdf`: Final project report

## Overview
The project uses structured clinical data to build interpretable models for heart disease risk prediction. Emphasis is placed on recall, probability calibration, SHAP-based interpretability, and risk stratification for early screening and triage.

## Models
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest

## Key Features
- ROC-AUC–based evaluation with recall emphasis
- SHAP explanations for model transparency
- Risk stratification into low, medium, and high risk groups
- Probability calibration analysis
